Hey there visitor, I'm glad that you've somehow stumbled upon my blog!

I'm Jesal Mistry, the owner of this blog. Born in India, raised and schooled in Kuwait, I completed my Computer Engineering from Pune. I've worked as a Software Quality Analyst & Consultant at ThoughtWorks for 3 years.

I like to blog about a wide range of topics that I find interesting. These can be anything from past experiences and conversations with strangers to random thoughts while daydreaming or life learning that I've had. Pretty much anything that'd prove to be stimulating for my Brain.

My hope is that you, my audience, can relate to and/or comment on my posts. In doing so, I believe that I've given you some food for thought.

Do you want your story told, experience shared or thoughts pondered upon by others, but don't have a blog? I encourage guest authors on my blog. So feel free to reach out to me at [@jesalnmistry](https://twitter.com/jesalnmistry).

Happy reading!
