Hey there visitor, I'm glad that you've somehow stumbled upon my blog! My name is Jesal Mistry, the owner of this blog. Welcome.

I like to blog about a wide range of topics that I find interesting. These can be anything from past experiences and conversations with strangers to random thoughts while daydreaming or life learnings that I've had. Pretty much anything that'd prove to be stimulating for my Brain.

My hope is that you, my audience, can relate to and/or comment on my posts. In doing so, I believe that I've given you some food for thought.

Happy reading!
