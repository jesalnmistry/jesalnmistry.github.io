Our time in this world is a limited one and in that time, we come across and interact with a lot of other human beings. Starting from our family, to our friends, from our teachers and professors to colleagues at work, from complete strangers to people we've loved and lost. We humans are social animals and rarely do we tend to drift away from that basic instinct.

At it's very core, I belive that humans are a bucket full of emotions. Each of us is going through emotions and some of us have mastered the art of camouflaging it in our own ways. It may be a friend who is going throuh a tough breakup, a colleague who is having financial problems, or a family member suffering from health problems, one can only guess.

Even though we have all the tools to connect and stay in touch, the social media, the countless messaging apps, one may still find it difficult to express their emotions. I've seen friends fight depression, overcome financial problems and some sort out their personal shortcomings. They are all brave warriors in their own ways. Some of us may also be having positive emotions of happiness, excitement or love. Sharing that with compliments & acknowledgement is equally important.

With all this, it becomes important for us to be supportive and caring. Lending a shoulder to cry on, ears to hear problems, saying words of encouragement or even sitting with them in silence can go a long way and be a major boost for their struggles.

Never underestimate the power of a simple act of kindness. So, the next time you take that uber, place an order with a waiter, or talking with customer service, don't forget to smile & acknowledge their efforts. You never know, you could just end up making their day!

Because I truly belive that, "People may forget what you said, what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel." :)
