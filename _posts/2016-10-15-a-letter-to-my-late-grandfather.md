Dearest Dadu,

Wish you are very Happy Birthday! How I wish you were here and we all could celebrate your birthday together like old times! However, I hope you are doing well, up in the heavens. Speaking of celebrations, I recently watched the M.S. Dhoni biopic. Took me back to the day we watched the 2011 World Cup final together. I could still remember the smile on your face when he hit the winning 6. We celebrated and saw history being made together in that hospital room.

Let me begin by telling you that I've really dearly missed you. I still imagine that someday I'd get a skype or viber call from you on my phone. I've always been really proud that you always wanted to be in touch with everyone and needless to say technologically up to date.

Ba hasn't been too well since you've gone. I guess she never thought she'll have to live without you by her side. Initially it was difficult for us to understand her and her drastic behavior. She has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease coupled with Dementia. We are here to take care of her and the medicines are definitely helping. We try to make her smile and there are some lucky days when she remembers my name :)

I didn't realise that the last one year has passed by so fast. It has been a rollercoaster ride to be honest. From quitting my job to trying and find myself. In the last year, I've been unemployed and it's one decision I'm proud of. I was selfish this last year as I decided to invest time in myself. I must say that I've learnt a lot. 

One of the most important lessons I've learnt is something that you always told me about. Time is Money. I was naive back then, however now I'm slowly starting to realise what it really means. Most people value money a lot. Little do they realise that time is our real currency. How we spend our time, with whom we spend our time is probably the most important lesson one can learn. That family, friends and ourselves are the prime factor. I've learnt that things don't always turn out the way we plan. That sometimes, it's better to go with the flow and eventually the final picture will become clear.

They say that there is a reason why people come in our lives. There's so much to learn from everyone and it all helps us shape into the better person that we ought to become eventually. I'm very thankful that I've had you by my side. Thank you for always showering me with love and care. At the same time, I'm grateful that you were strict and stern when I was being childish and deviating from being a better person. There is so much more that comes to my mind and I'm sure I can go on forever. I want you to know that I'll always love you and you'll always be in my prayers.

Your grandson.
